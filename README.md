# Alexa-and-Blynk

In this repo, I've adapted my work with [Blynk](https://blynk.io/) of my garage doors. I kept the same code for Blynk, but I added the  [Kakopappa's Sinric service](https://sinric.com). You can check the GitHub of the Blynk Library [here] and the repo of Kakopappa [here](https://github.com/kakopappa/sinric).
